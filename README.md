This is my work of building a Scorbot ER-V Controller with an arduino MEGA and drivers.

The project description is here: http://whatimade.today/geekcon-xii-scorbot-learns-to-draw/

Files and Folders consist of:

scorbotCOMcontrol - Most updated code, can get 6 encoder values and moves towards them

python - Python code for drawing images with scorbot

files - Some modified files to use with the python code

Eagle - Arduino mega shield design for scorbot

scorbotShieldTest - Shield Test...

Pins - Scorbot 50 Pins Data

ER3-Manual - Scorbot Manual


scorbotOldTestCode - My early work on scorbot, described here: http://www.whatimade.today/my-name-is-scorbot/

* Encoder_Scorbot - CPP code for encoders, taken and modified from  https://github.com/frodofski/Encoder_Polling_V2

* ScorbotCmd - The final code for controlling the Scorbot (Under Construction)

* ScorbotTest - Test code for Motors, Encoders and MicroSwitches
